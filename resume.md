EXPERIENCE
TECHNYX
Senior AI Engineer
Lead end-to-end lifecycle of AI projects from data collection and prepro-
cessing through model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring
in production environments.
Built MVP for automated RMG QA/QC platform with LiDAR and
Raspberry Pi, reducing inference time from 4.5s to 0.8s per request by
implementing Nvidia Triton Inference Server with TensorRT and achiev-
ing 40% VRAM reduction for cost-effective cloud computing.
Developed production frontend services using TypeScript, Vite, and
React, implementing Redis-based caching and search artifacts storage
that improved search performance by 60%.
Optimized Point Cloud data handling by utilizing binary numpy arrays
for in-memory processing on Raspberry Pi devices, eliminating expen-
sive disk I/O operations and ensuring smooth client operations.
Mentored junior engineers and collaborated with cross-functional teams
to integrate AI solutions into production systems while conducting code
reviews to maintain high-quality software development standards.
